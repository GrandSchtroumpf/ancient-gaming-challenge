# Ancient Gaming Challenge



Demo: 

Note: I decided to play with the new color features in CSS. Some browser might not support it (Firefox mobile for example). I would recommand to use a Chromium based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, ...).

## Getting Started
```
npm install
npm start
```
Visit: http://localhost:5173/

Note: In devmode Qwik doesn't use caching, so each operation takes time.

## Static Site Generator (Node.js)

```
npm run build.server
```
